# Best Courses
As a learner, the first and the most important thing is to find a course, either a book or a video course. A good course could accelarate your progress by a big scale. We will continuely collecte courses for each area and pop the best one to the top based on the votes from experts.

Quality is the only thing we pay attention to. When a course proposal is present, an article or short summary about why it's good is needed, which indicates the proposer should be really satisfied by this course on his/her own.

We welcome collaborators to share your treasures. Learning is always the most exciting and interesting thing.
